# Product Context: Device Masker

## Problem

Android apps can collect identifiers and signals that become a device fingerprint:
- Android ID, Advertising ID, GSF-like identifiers, and Media DRM identifiers.
- Telephony identifiers such as IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, MCC/MNC, carrier name, and phone number.
- Network signals such as Wi-Fi MAC, SSID, BSSID, Bluetooth address, and network operator.
- Build and system profile values such as manufacturer, model, fingerprint, serial, board, brand, and hardware.
- Locale, timezone, location, and sensor metadata.
- Installed packages, stack traces, loaded maps, and other evidence of LSPosed or hook frameworks.

Researchers need a controlled way to present consistent alternate identities to selected apps without modifying those apps.

## Product Shape

Device Masker has three product-facing responsibilities:

1. Configuration app
   - Enable/disable the module globally.
   - Create and edit spoof groups.
   - Assign apps to groups.
   - Generate and persist stable identity values.
   - Sync configuration to libxposed RemotePreferences.
   - Export rootless app logs and available diagnostics.

2. Xposed module
   - Loads only in LSPosed-scoped processes.
   - Reads RemotePreferences from the libxposed service bridge.
   - Applies hooks only for enabled target apps and enabled spoof types.
   - Returns original values whenever config is unsafe.
   - Logs hook and spoof events to LSPosed Manager logs.

3. Diagnostics and verification
   - Shows app-side service/config/log state.
   - Treats custom AIDL diagnostics as best-effort.
   - Uses LSPosed logs as the reliable proof that target-process hooks loaded and fired.

## Expected User Flow

1. Install Device Masker.
2. Enable it as an LSPosed module.
3. Scope `android`, `system`, and the selected target apps.
4. Open Device Masker and wait for libxposed service connection.
5. Create or select a spoof group.
6. Assign target apps to that group.
7. Enable specific spoof types and verify generated values.
8. Force-stop and relaunch target apps.
9. Validate with LSPosed logs and an identifier-checking app.

## Working Base

The first working base was validated on 2026-05-02:
- Target app: `com.mantle.verify`.
- Target process started under LSPosed after crash remediation.
- Hooks registered.
- Multiple spoof events were emitted to LSPosed logs.
- Earlier startup crash signatures were absent in the final smoke check.

This proves the architecture can work end to end for at least one scoped target under the current emulator setup. It does not prove stable release readiness.

## UX Principles

- Never imply that app launch alone proves hook success.
- Distinguish app-side Xposed service connection from target-process hook registration.
- Prefer clear status labels over optimistic activation claims.
- Keep configuration recoverable and stable.
- Make development limitations visible.
- Encourage LSPosed log verification after changing scope, module state, or target app config.

## Correct Hook Behavior

For each target app and spoof type:
- If the module is disabled, return the original value.
- If the app is not enabled in `AppConfig`, return the original value.
- If the assigned group is missing or disabled, return the original value.
- If the spoof type is disabled, blank, missing, or malformed, return the original value.
- If a valid stored value exists and the type is enabled, return the stored spoofed value.

## Primary Product Risk

Target apps can fail during startup when hooks are too invasive, too early, or inconsistent. The latest working base was achieved by favoring pass-through safety and disabling global class lookup anti-detection by default.
