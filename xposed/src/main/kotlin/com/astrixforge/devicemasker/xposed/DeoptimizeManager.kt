/**
 * Centralized ART deoptimization manager for libxposed API 100.
 *
 * ## Why deoptimize() is critical
 *
 * ART's JIT (Just-In-Time) and AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilers aggressively inline short methods. Any
 * method shorter than ~20 bytecodes — such as `TelephonyManager.getImei()` or `Build.getSerial()` —
 * may be inlined directly into the caller's compiled machine code. When that happens, your Xposed
 * hook on the method object is never invoked; the app reads the real value and our hook is silently
 * skipped.
 *
 * `xi.deoptimize(method)` tells ART: "do not optimize away calls to this method — always dispatch
 * through the method table." This forces ART to recompile the method in interpreter mode (or
 * de-optimized compiled mode), ensuring every call goes through our hook callback.
 *
 * ## Usage rule
 * - ALWAYS call deoptimize() AFTER xi.hook() — deoptimizing before hooking is a no-op.
 * - It is idempotent — calling it multiple times on the same method is safe.
 * - Cost is one-time at module load time (~10-50ms total for all methods). After that, all
 *   subsequent calls route through hooks with no additional overhead.
 *
 * ## When to deoptimize
 * - All TelephonyManager getters (getImei, getSubscriberId, etc.) — always JIT-compiled
 * - All Build.* static field accessors — inlined by startup code
 * - SubscriptionInfo getters — heavily used by banking apps
 * - WebView UA / UserAgent strings — read at WebView init time (early, often AOT)
